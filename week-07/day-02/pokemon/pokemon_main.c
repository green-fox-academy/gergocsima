 * The "pokemon"-s are stored in an array.

 * Write the following functions:
 * 1) Get faster pokemons than
 *      - parameters:
 *          - array
 *          - array length
 *          - speed
 *      - it returns the count of the faster pokemons than the parameter "speed"
 * 2) Get type count
 *      - parameters:
 *          - array
 *          - array length
 *          - type
 *      - it returns the count of pokemons which are "type"
 * 3) Get strongest type
 *      - parameters:
 *          - array
 *          - array length
 *          - strength
 *      - it returns the type of the strongest pokemon
 * 4) Get maximal strength of a type
 *      - parameters:
 *          - array
 *          - array length
 *          - type
 *      - it returns the highest strength among the "type" type pokemons
 *
 * Don't forget to handle invalid inputs (NULL pointers, invalid values etc.)
